## The whole show is an AngularJS application

*Slide content is compiled by AngularJS, so you can use directives, or even extend the application as you want.*

### Working example :

<div class="left">
Your name: <input ng-model="name" name="name" autocomplete="off"><br/>
<span class="result">Hello {{name}}!</span>
</div>
